Connect 4 is a game that has been around for generations. Play with familie or close friends. Player One will have red tokens and player Two will have blue tokens. The first player to place 4 tokens together in a row, column or horizontally will be declared the winner! If neither player is able to place 4 in a row and all the placeholders are taken, the game is declared a tie. After the game competes and a winner or tie is declared, you can reset the board with the reset button at the bottom.  This game offers a classic game board with a simple, cluster free background.
