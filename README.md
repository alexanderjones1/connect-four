Connect _Four_ is a strategy game that has been around for generations. Player one will have red tokens, and player two will have blue tokens. The first player to place 4 tokens together in a row, column, or horizontally will be declared the winner! If neither player is able to place 4 in a row and all the placeholders are taken, the game is declared a tie. After the game has ended and a winner or a tie is declared, you can reset the board by clicking the reset button located at the bottom.
